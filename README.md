# SMG2 Project Template
You can find here the source code for all custom coded objects and changes featured in the **SMG2 Project Template**. Compiled builds and the actual download can be found under **Releases**. This requires [Syati](https://github.com/shibbo/Syati), a toolchain by shibbo to inject custom code into SMG2.
You can find more information and videos on [Aurum's website](https://aurumsmods.com/#project-template).

**This repository has beta features of the SMG2PT that are not fully finished.**

If you are not willing to work with potentially unfinished or broken features, please use [the main Project Template repository](https://github.com/SunakazeKun/SMG2-Project-Template).

To build, use [Lord_Giganticus's](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Syati) Syati fork.

There are also pre-compiled builds of this repo.

Please report issues to Evanbowl#9157 on Discord.

Current Beta features:<br />
- StageEventDataTable<br />
- Updated PowerStarColors<br />
- Old Red Launch Star (though the path color is blue)<br />
- WarpArea and WarpAreaStageTable<br />
- SwitchBox <br />
- PowerStarSpawner rewrite <br />

This repo also includes the Whitehole Object Database, that has all the new PT stuff inside it.

It's optional, but recommended to enable the Dolphin Log when testing on Dolphin Emulator. Some of the new stuff prints to the log if things go wrong.

This version of Project Template does NOT work with SuperHackio's GalaxyLevelEngine, but Project Template as of the August Update does work.
