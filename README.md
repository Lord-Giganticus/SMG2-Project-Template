# SMG2 Project Template
You can find here the source code for all custom coded objects and changes featured in the **SMG2 Project Template**. Compiled builds and the actual download can be found under **Releases**. This requires [Syati](https://github.com/shibbo/Syati), a toolchain by shibbo to inject custom code into SMG2.
You can find more information and videos on [my website](https://aurumsmods.com/#project-template).

This repository has beta features of the SMG2PT that are not fully finished.
To build, use [Lord_Giganticus's](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Syati) Syati fork.

There are also pre-compiled builds of this repo.
