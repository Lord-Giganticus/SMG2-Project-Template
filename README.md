# SMG2 Project Template
You can find here the source code for all custom coded objects and changes featured in the **SMG2 Project Template**. Compiled builds and the actual download can be found under **Releases**. This requires [Syati](https://github.com/shibbo/Syati), a toolchain by shibbo to inject custom code into SMG2.
You can find more information and videos on [my website](https://aurumsmods.com/#project-template).

**This repository has beta features of the SMG2PT that are not fully finished.**

If you are not willing to work with potentially unfinished/broken features, please use the main PT repository.

To build, use [Lord_Giganticus's](https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/Syati) Syati fork.

There are also pre-compiled builds of this repo.

Please report issues to Evanbowl#9157 on Discord.

There's also a new SystemData directory in this repo. Inside that are two .ARC files.<br/>
Both of them need to go in the SystemData directory in your game data. The game will crash without them!<br/>

Current Beta features:<br />
- StageEventDataTable<br />
- Updated PowerStarColors<br />
- Old Red Launch Star (though the path color is blue)<br />
- WarpArea and WarpAreaStageTable<br />

- SwitchBox <br />
- PowerStarSpawner rewrite <br />

This repo also includes the Whitehole Object Database, that has all the new PT stuff inside it.
